<blockquote class="lore">As a Vex simulation plunged the Last City into darkness, the Vanguard turned to the Eilksni Splicer, Mithrax, for raid. In return, Ikora offered to shelter House Light within the City's walls - a controversial decision. With Mithrax's help, the Guardians learned to delve deep into the Vex network. There, they discovered the true mastermind behind the Endless Night: Quria, Blade Transform.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="lore">After defeating Quria as well as a treasonous Vex invasion of the Last City led by faction leader Lakshmi-2, the Guardians successfully lifted the Endless Night. Mithrax and House Light remain in the Eliksni Quarter as allies of the Vanguard.</blockquote>
