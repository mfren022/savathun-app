<blockquote class="lore">Caiatl, Empress of the Cabal, led her fleet to the Sol system and offered a deal to Zavala: swear fealty, and defeat the Hive together. The commander refused.</blockquote>
<blockquote class="lore">The Guardians undermined Caiatl's attempts to form a war council, defeating her champions in ritual combat. Cabal renegades attempted to kill Zavala, but Crow foiled the plot, revealing his identity in the process. Zavala and Caiatl agreed on a truce.</blockquote>
